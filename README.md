# FlowCraft - React Flow CSV Data Manipulator

This is the FlowCraft project, a React.js application built using React Flow, React Redux, Shade-CN, React Router DOM, and Papa Parse. It allows you to manipulate CSV data by performing operations such as sorting, filtering, slicing, and grouping. The manipulated data can be previewed in a table format and downloaded as either CSV or JSON.

## Installation

Clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/imvikashdev/react-flow-example.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd react-flow-example
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the FlowCraft application on a local development server.

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready build of the FlowCraft application.

## Live Demo

You can access the live demo of the FlowCraft application at [https://flowcraft.imvikash.dev/](https://flowcraft.imvikash.dev/).

## Scripts

The available scripts in this project are:

- `dev`: Starts the development server using Vite.
- `build`: Transpiles the TypeScript code using TypeScript Compiler (tsc) and then builds the application using Vite.
- `lint`: Runs ESLint to lint the TypeScript and TypeScript React files.
- `preview`: Starts a preview server to preview the production build of the application.

## Supported Data Operations

The FlowCraft application supports the following data operations:

- Data Sorting: Sort the data based on one or more columns.
- Data Filtering: Filter the data based on specified conditions.
- Data Slicing: Extract a portion of the data based on specified start and end indices.
- Data Grouping: Group the data based on one or more columns.

## Data Preview and Download
